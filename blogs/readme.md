# Blogs Directory

This dir contains the raw markdown for blog content.

Could eventually be moved to some external store.
But including the markdown here will cause the server to rebuild every push.
Reading the blogs from a static directory at build time will generate static server side rendered HTML for each post.
This is fast and gets most of the value for least effort.
